logic:

o  Add the ability to do continous contrasts.  Namely, don't break into
   sentence.  Just use free flowing text, html tags and everything.  Then
   every 10 or so words, try a different direction and let it rip for 20
   words.  Now compute the likelihood of both paths.  Be careful of
   pushing stuff to the future--so links that never come down should be
   penalized. 

o  Added the ability to make a new eigen-dictionary based off of
   bigrams computed between parent-child pairs.

Experiments:

o  force locality by giving likelihood advantage to it (this might not be
   necessary with new loss)

o  Find some labelled data to run on.  Write a likelihood estimator based
   on the correct parse.  Number of edges correct?  Right direction of
   dependence? guess as to distance?

Build a new google grams dictionary which doesn't downcase.  This
might help with understanding start of sentences etc.



LOW PRIORITY

speedup: There is a map in value_of_forecasts which should be replaced
by an vector for speed.

speedup: profile code to see what actually is taking time.
